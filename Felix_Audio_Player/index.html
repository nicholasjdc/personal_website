  <p>This is a simple, sample-based coding language. Within a statement
    there are three values demarcated by "@" signs: sample name, gain value,
    and sleep value. Sample name is a string entry, and gain and sleep values 
    are equations whose values are evaluated by conventional javascript syntax.
    The sleep value is the number of seconds between each repetition of the
    sample.

  <p>Example:</p>
  <p>clap@1@1</p>
  <textarea type="text" id = "code" name="code"
  rows="10" cols="33">clap@1@1</textarea>
  <p></p>
  <button>re-evaluate</button>
  <p id = "qi">Queued Iteration:</p>
  <p id ="ci">Current Iteration:</p>
