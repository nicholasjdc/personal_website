  <h1>Invictus</h1>
  <h2>by William Ernest Henley</h2>
  
<p>
Out of the night that covers me, <br>
Black as the pit from pole to pole, <br> 
I thank whatever gods may be <br>
For my unconquerable soul. <br>
  </p>
<p>
In the fell clutch of circumstance <br>
I have not winced nor cried aloud. <br> 
Under the bludgeonings of chance <br>
My head is bloody, but unbowed. <br>
  </p>
<p>
Beyond this place of wrath and tears <br>
Looms but the Horror of the shade, <br>
And yet the menace of the years <br>
Finds and shall find me unafraid. <br>
  </p>
<p>
It matters not how strait the gate, <br>
How charged with punishments the scroll, <br> 
I am the master of my fate, <br>
I am the captain of my soul. <br>

  <h1>If—</h1>
  <h2>by Rudyard Kipling</h2>

<p>
If you can keep your head when all about you <br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br>
But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, <br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, <br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <br>
  </p>
<p>
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master; <br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; <br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br>
And treat those two impostors just the same; <br> 
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken <br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br>
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <br>
  </p>
<p>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br>
And never breathe a word about your loss; <br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br>
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br>
  </p>
<p>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, <br>
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, <br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br>
If all men count with you, but none too much; <br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, <br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, <br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son! <br>

  <h1>Do not go gentle into that good night</h1>
  <h2>by Dylan Thomas</h2>
  
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night, <br>
Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
  </p>
<p>
Though wise men at their end know dark is right, <br>
Because their words had forked no lightning they <br>
Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
  </p>
<p>
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright <br>
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
  </p>
<p>
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, <br>
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, <br>
Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
  </p>
<p>
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight <br>
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
  </p>
<p>
And you, my father, there on the sad height, <br>
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. <br>
Do not go gentle into that good night. <br>
Rage, rage against the dying of the light. <br>
  </p>
