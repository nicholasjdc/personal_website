 <p>Constructing the phone buttons and dialtone were initially 
  straightforward, allowing me to simply follow the diagram 
  provided in the textbook. Taking inspirations from the 
  dialtone, I then modified the buttons with the bypass 
  filters from the dialtone, as those filters were initially 
  meant to replicate the material limitations on the tone, 
  which would logically follow to the phone buttons. The
  dialtone sounded off with the clip which I had initially 
  implemented, but I wanted some "staticy" sound which was
  similar. I then implemented some low shelf white noise
  directly into the output, but found it did not fit with the 
  tone. I then tried feeding the white noise into the secondary
  bypass filter, which sounded ok, but too one-note. I then added
  in highshelf filter, which felt somewhat better but negligibly so.
  I then played around with a variety of filters, and landed on the peaking
  filter, as I liked the texture of the noise, like slipping
  sand. For whatever reason it sounded more right for me
  to pass the high and low shelf filters into the peaking, so I
  ended up with white noise being passed into a low and high shelf filter,
  both of them being passed into a peaking filter, and finally 
  ending up in the bpFilter2. While I feel like the sound sounds
  more realistic at lower volumes, when listening closely at 
  higher volumes it feels even more wrong than without any white noise.</p>
